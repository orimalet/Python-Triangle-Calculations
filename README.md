# Python-Triangle-Calculations
Python program which performs calculations relating to triangles.

The program should first enter into a main menu, giving the user a choice of entering the number "1" , "2", or "3" . Entering the characher "q" should exit the program.

If ther user enters "1" at the main menu: The program will calculate a missing internal angle, given two internal angles (in degrees). The user should be prompted for each internal angle via a separate prompt, ie: The user is prompted for angle 1, presses enter, and is then prompted for angle 2. The program then calculates the missing angle, and prints all three angles in a nice format. The program should then return to the main menu. 

If the user enters "2" at the main menu: The program will calculate the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angle triangle, given the length of the two other sides (in cm). The user should be prompted, and the calculation should be reported in a similar fashion to the first task. The program should then return to the main menu.

If the user enters "3" at the main menu: The program will calculate the area of a triangle, given the lengths of the three sides (in cm). The user should be prompted, and the calculation should be reported in a similar fashion to the other tasks. The program should then return to the main menu.
